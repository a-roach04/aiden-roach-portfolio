After undergraduate school, I want to go to graduate school for a Ph.D. in ecology or population biology. For my career, I want to study the migration patterns of large mammals to make urban development friendlier towards our animal neighbors. Whenever I have free time, I like to go tidepooling, crochet, and watch romance movies with my cat Moose.\n\n\n\nMe and my Moose!\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, Moose helps me with my coding. He’s a smart boy."

Then I would color by species to show when certain species were present or absent. For plant communities, I would have a bar chart with community on the x axis and overall species richness on the y axis. I might also split the data into small, medium, and large mammal categories to declutter the graphics.\n\n\n\n2.\nWhat do you want to highlight on your final visualizations in order to answer your research questions?

    "text": "Data Description\nFor this project, I used a dataset looking at mammal abundance in Prince Albert National Park in Canada. The data was collected using seven snow transects. After 48 hours, the tracks left by mammals were recorded every 100 meters. The transects were refreshed either by fresh snowfall or by a drag pulled by a snowmobile. There are a lot of variables included, but the most important ones for my research questions are period which is recorded as a character, month, day, and year which are recorded as integers, cloudcover which is an integer, precipitation which is a character, temperature which is an integer, and plant community which is a character. Each species is listed as a variable with their presence recorded at a one and their absence recorded as a zero. Some research questions I want to answer are how does species abundance vary over time, over temperature, and over different plant communities?\n\n\nData Cleaning\nIn order to answer these research questions, the data has to be edited to make visualization easier. First, I selected only the variables I am interested in. Then, since values considered N/A were not recognized by R, I had to reassign the missing values so that R could understand those values were missing. Next, I reassigned the types of variables recorded to ensure that words were being interpreted by R as words and that numbers were being interpreted by R as numbers. The final step to clean this data was rotating the data so that each row contained the information for a singular observation rather than multiple. This makes visualization much easier!\n\n\nPlant Communities\nParagraph\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn plot showing relationship between plant community and average species richness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn plot showing relationship of number of observed mammals across plant communities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nparagraph\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot showing relationship between daily temperature, in Celsius, and average species richness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolar axis plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Period\nparagraph\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn chart showing relationship between time period and average species richness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn chart showing relationship of number of observed mammals across time periods"
